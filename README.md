## Description
The __Football Match Analysis Using YOLO__ project is an AI-powered system designed to analyze football match videos, extracting player positions, speeds, and distances covered. By leveraging YOLO for object detection and roboflow [football dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-jvuqo/football-players-detection-3zvbc/dataset/1) for fine-tuning, this project assigns team colors, tracks ball possession, and adjusts camera movements to provide a comprehensive view of player performance and match dynamics.


## Features
- __Player Tracking and Team Assignment:__ Detects players and assigns them to teams based on jersey color.
- __Speed and Distance Calculation:__ Estimates player speeds and distances covered using advanced tracking algorithms.
- __Ball Possession Detection:__ Identifies which player has possession of the ball at each frame.
- __Camera Movement Adjustment:__ Adapts player positioning for dynamic camera angles using a perspective transformer.
- __Flask Interface:__ Provides an interface for users to upload match clips and customize tracking options for the final output.


## Requirements
- **Python**: 3.11.5
- **Dependencies**: Install all required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Football-Match-Analysis-Using-YOLO
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended)**:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows
```
3. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. **Update Configurations**:
- Open `config.json` and update parameters like model paths, video titles, and other constants used in the project.

## Usage
1. Run `main.py` or `app.py`
```bash
python main.py
```
2. Check Output folder.

## Model Performance & Evaluation
YOLO model was fine-tuned on a football dataset to classify objects more accurately.

**Dataset**: [Football Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-jvuqo/football-players-detection-3zvbc/dataset/1)
- __Confusion Matrix__
  ![confusion_matrix](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01c7907e-db6b-4f5f-acdc-fe738bb3c815)

- __F1 & Confidence and Precision & Recall Curve__

![F1_curve](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbea5803-5267-47ac-857a-1082c444805e)
![PR_curve](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/435b17d0-4414-429b-b672-d767b5f30cbb)

**Note**: Due to lack of samples, PR and F1 Score for ball and background seems to very less than expected.
